I look forward to finding sparks.\n\nLearning: I have 20+ years experience and a solid product sense, but I've learnt the hard way it's not *my* ideas that matter. The real power of product management lies in creating space for learning.\n\nCuriosity invites new mental models, fresh viewpoints, unexpected opportunities, and the complexity of life. I look forward to learning something new.\n\nFun: This is foundational. When you work on a compelling challenge with good, smart people that you respect and can laugh with, everything flows smoother.

Stayed hobby level for a while.\n\n**Late 90s:** Studying biology at university. The Internet happened - dot.com boom. Before that, the coolest thing was an under-construction GIF or a hit counter. Now there was disruption - competition between search engines, online shopping, travel reservations. Kids in bedrooms and garages were reshaping entire bricks and mortar industries. I had to get involved.\n\nStarted learning to make websites, design and code. Completed my degree, took a one-year Masters in IT.\n\n**2001-2004:** Graduated just as the dot.com bubble popped. No jobs. Freelance web design. Co-founded TextualHealing.com - mobile barcode tickets via MMS. Good idea, too early, never launched. [TQ.FAILURE.SHIP]\n\n**2003:** Eventually got a foot in the door answering phones at a web hosting company. Good at it (won the annual sales competition), but not my passion.\n\nAttracted by reach and impact - I wanted to do web. They had a website, but I thought I could do better. In evenings and weekends I made an alternative website, convinced a manager to try it out (1m visits), sales went up. Next week I was in the web design team. [HOST.R3.STORY.ALTSITE]\n\n**2004-2005:** 6 months later, I was leading the web design team. Reinvented the domain search process - first use of AJAX - revenue up 20% overnight. Became industry standard. [HOST.R2.STORY.DOMAIN]\n\n**2005-2006:** Via acquisitions, became part of Pipex - the UK's 4th largest broadband provider. Group Design Manager across multiple offices.\n\n**2006-2008:** Head of New Media at Host Europe Group. Managed all online channels across all brands. Member of Senior Management Team. Still in my 20s. 123-reg.co.uk became first company to register 1 million .uk domains. [HOST]\n\n**2008-2010:** Wanted to try something new. Switched to UK2 Group - another hosting company, but with an interesting Danish CEO with a disruptive mindset (JustEat, Zetland etc). By now doing a mix of web, marketing and product - wherever the opportunity was. Troubleshooter to CEO across UK, US, Ukraine offices. [UK2]\n\n**2010:** Met a girl on a ski slope and moved to Denmark. Went to school to learn Danish (Prøve i Dansk 3) and got involved in the Danish startup scene. Independent consulting - mix of web, ecommerce, marketing, growth. Lots of fun.\n\n**2013-2014:** EuroDNS - Marketing Director. Turnaround project. Reversed 4-year decline, doubled organic traffic, halved bounce rate. Hybrid remote setup that worked really well. [EURODNS]\n\n**2014-2016:** Opbeat - Head of Marketing. SaaS startup backed by cofounders of Facebook and Instagram. Built brand and channels from scratch. Trebled traffic and sign-ups. Later acquired by Elastic. [OPBEAT]\n\n**2016:** TwentyThree - rescued global launch on 6-week deadline. Contract role. [T23]\n\n**2016-2020:** Targeted health-tech as the last place to be disrupted by web.\n\nLEO Innovation Lab - a super interesting place. Arms-length product incubator, with the goal of disrupting LEO before someone else does. Brought in experts from across industries, time was the only limited factor. Move fast. Accelerated learning. Formative career moment, learnt so much. [LEO]\n\nInnovation Lab model ultimately not sustainable. Lab was super innovative, but parent company was unchanged. Need to disrupt from within. [LEO.STORY.MODEL]\n\n**2020-2022:** Product role at Novo Nordisk, convinced the business (in my final round job interview) to set aside their solution-first brief and start with the problem instead. Used this as a mandate to completely reinvent their ways of working. [NOVO.R1.TRANSFORM] Created a meaningful product that's still live today. Built a weight-loss prediction algorithm - later spun out into API product.\n\nAsked to scale this way of working across the organisation. Promoted to Associate Director [NOVO.R2], and helped move the business to the product operating model.\n\n**2026:** AI changes everything. Same feeling as the 90s.\n\nWant to know more?

The result: significant delays (backlogs could mean months), huge documentation overhead, and an anti-pattern where you had to fully develop everything before getting sign-off.\n\nI used an internal LLM sandbox to create a RAG model that captured the various guidelines and regulations. Now we could automatically document and review each submission with a full audit trail - the review team only had to rubber-stamp the release.\n\nI also built a prototype agent that plugged into Figma, so designers could query the guidelines before investing too much effort. This allowed product teams to shift left - fail in design, not at review.\n\nThe product teams loved it. Organisational priorities later shifted and the project was handed to another team, but the proof of concept showed a clear path to dramatically faster release cycles.\n\n\n---\n\n# LEO INNOVATION LAB (2016-2020)",

LEO Innovation Lab was incredibly agile, with rapid learning cycles and brilliant peers.\n\nBut the parent ship continued sailing unchanged. We were too remote.

I try to deeply understand the outcomes we're trying to achieve, the system relationships, and ultimately where to build and why.\n\nThis generally involves talking to a bunch of people and asking obvious questions. I read, sketch, observe, and listen. I keep layering in viewpoints and complexity; it will feel really uncomfortable until suddenly it doesn't.\n\nOnce you can trace across a system, the opportunities, levers and amplifiers tend to present themselves. I'll sketch hypotheses on paper, test with colleagues and see what holds up.\n\nFrom here, we switch into execution, and initiate the first learning loop.",
