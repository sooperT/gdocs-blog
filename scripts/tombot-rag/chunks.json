      "content": "Late 80s: First computer. Dad spent a month's salary on a home computer. Typing out BASIC from a magazine, syntax errors. Stayed hobby level for a while.\n\nLate 90s: Studying biology at university. The Internet happened - dot.com boom. Before that, the coolest thing was an under-construction GIF or a hit counter. Now there was disruption - competition between search engines, online shopping, travel reservations. Kids in bedrooms and garages were reshaping entire bricks and mortar industries. I had to get involved.\n\nStarted learning to make websites, design and code. Completed my degree, took a one-year Masters in IT.\n\n2001-2004: Graduated just as the dot.com bubble popped. No jobs. Freelance web design. Co-founded TextualHealing.com - mobile barcode tickets via MMS. Good idea, too early, never launched. Learning: ship in small increments, don't polish forever.\n\n2003: Eventually got a foot in the door answering phones at a web hosting company. Good at it (won the annual sales competition), but not my passion. Attracted by reach and impact - I wanted to do web. In evenings and weekends I made an alternative website, convinced a manager to try it out, sales went up. Next week I was in the web design team.\n\n2004-2008: Six months later, I was leading the web design team. Reinvented the domain search process - first use of AJAX - revenue up 20% overnight. Became industry standard. Via acquisitions, became part of Pipex (UK's 4th largest broadband provider). Then Head of New Media at Host Europe Group, managing all online channels. Member of Senior Management Team. Still in my 20s.\n\n2008-2010: Switched to UK2 Group - another hosting company with interesting Danish CEO with disruptive mindset (JustEat, Zetland). By now doing a mix of web, marketing and product - wherever the opportunity was. Troubleshooter to CEO across UK, US, Ukraine offices.\n\n2010: Met a girl on a ski slope and moved to Denmark. Went to school to learn Danish (Prøve i Dansk 3). Independent consulting - mix of web, ecommerce, marketing, growth.\n\n2013-2016: EuroDNS turnaround (reversed 4-year decline). Then Opbeat - SaaS startup backed by Facebook/Instagram cofounders. Built brand from scratch, trebled traffic. Later acquired by Elastic. Then rescued TwentyThree global launch on 6-week deadline.\n\n2016-2020: Fell into health-tech as \"the last place to be disrupted by web.\" LEO Innovation Lab - super interesting place. Arms-length product incubator. Move fast. Accelerated learning. Formative career moment. TREAT, Skincoach, Diagnosis App.\n\n2020-2024: Novo Nordisk. Built Wegovycare, convinced business to start with problem not solution. Created incubation model. Invited onto Wegovy Pill launch. Head of product operations. Built GenAI proof of concept.\n\n2026: AI changes everything. Same feeling as the 90s.",

The app was designed to help patients manage side effects from their treatment.\n\nIt was a really difficult project, intense and emotionally demanding. I remember sitting at my desk, headphones on, listening to patient interviews and crying.\n\nIt made me think about product work completely differently. Every decision had to be intentional and judged with sensitivity. We couldn't \"move fast and break things\" - we had to get it right.\n\nWorked under challenging compliance constraints. Managed stakeholders and negotiated a novel partnership model.\n\nThe app meaningfully improved quality of life in terminally ill cancer patients. It made their final months better, and in some cases allowed them to stay on treatment for longer - gaining additional months to spend with their families, settle their affairs and say goodbye.\n\nIt only launched to a limited pilot audience in Spain and France, but it really helped those who used it. The partnership model was later adopted by Amgen core business as an exemplar for innovation.\n\nCompleted the full product lifecycle in 8 months, on time and on budget.\n\nLearning: Not every product is about growth metrics or conversion funnels.

The industry standard for domain search was clunky: enter name, pick extension from dropdown, hit search. Separate API call per registry meant users searched one domain at a time.\n\nUsers could only search for one domain at a time and kept running into domains that were already taken. Frustrating experience, poor conversion.\n\nI reinvented the process: simple text field, interpret input, search all extensions asynchronously. First use of AJAX in our stack. This sped up the search process and drastically increased the likelihood of finding a good domain name.\n\nResult: Revenue increased 20% overnight. This approach became the industry standard - if you search for a domain anywhere today, this is how it works.\n\nLearning: The best innovations come from questioning assumptions baked into technical constraints.

I used this as a mandate to completely reinvent their ways of working: running discovery, prototyping, patient interviews, iterative development.\n\nShifted release cycles from yearly to bi-monthly in a high-regulation environment. Identified a key growth lever and built a weight-loss prediction algorithm from concept to prototype.\n\nCreated a meaningful product that resonated with patients and affiliates. Achieved 10% penetration in our first national market. The product is still live today.\n\nAsked to scale this way of working across the organisation. Created an incubation model. Moved the business toward a product operating model.\n\nThe algorithm was later spun out into a new API product.\n\nLearning: The poor decision is anchoring on your own ideas and locking out the possibility of better alternatives.

TREAT was the first product to launch and had received significant coverage, but behind the scenes it was in trouble: massive tech debt, no prioritisation, flaky metrics, no roadmap, unclear reporting structure, massive churn, no pathway to profitability.\n\nThe product had an existing team of about 15 people, including a product lead and product manager. They were both passionate about the product, but were unfortunately in over their heads.\n\nWe needed to be delicate. We wanted to keep their passion and expertise, but help them out.\n\nI started as a consultant for the first month to see how we got along. After that month, it was proposed that I become the lead, with them reporting to me.\n\nThis required trust and humility from everyone. I appreciated it could be difficult for them, so I gave them the option to veto it - I would consult elsewhere, no hard feelings. But we went ahead.\n\nWhat followed was intense. Lots of fires, lots of chaos, blurred reporting lines, people problems, management issues, inconsistent and misleading data. It culminated in the bold decision to pause the service so we could refactor faster.\n\nTeam morale hit rock bottom. Really tough.\n\nBut we kept the faith. New cadences, new ways of working. We went through the tough time together, and came out the other side not only intact, but better and stronger - with real trust.\n\nWe halved acquisition costs and increased activation 7x. And when I ultimately recommended closing the product, the team understood why. That's only possible when there's trust.\n\nLearning: You can't turn around a product without bringing the people with you. The metrics matter, but the team comes first.

It's about doing whatever's needed to find and follow the opportunity.\n\nWhen working on something new, I usually start from first principles. I try to deeply understand the outcomes we're trying to achieve, the system relationships, and ultimately where to build and why.\n\nThis generally involves talking to a bunch of people, and asking a bunch of obvious questions. I read, sketch, observe, and listen. I keep layering in viewpoints and complexity; it will feel really uncomfortable until suddenly it doesn't.\n\nOnce you can trace across a system, the opportunities, levers and amplifiers tend to present themselves. I'll sketch hypotheses on paper, test with colleagues and see what holds up.\n\nFrom here, we switch into execution, and initiate the first learning loop.",

Their response was to create an arm's-length innovation lab (2016-2020) - better we disrupt ourselves than let a competitor do it.\n\nThe logic for keeping it separate made sense: to be truly innovative, you need completely different thinking, different ways of working. If you stay too close to the mothership, you just replicate what already exists.\n\nSo they brought in experts from all sorts of fields - only a few pharma people in key positions. A true melting pot.\n\nAnd it worked - in isolation. LEO Innovation Lab was incredibly agile, with rapid learning cycles and brilliant peers to learn from. It was a formative career moment for me.\n\nBut the parent ship continued sailing unchanged. We were too remote. The innovations we created struggled to find a home back in the core business.\n\nThe Lab was super innovative, but it didn't create the impact it needed to.\n\nLearning: You can't outsource disruption to a separate unit and graft it back on later. The parent organisation has to change too.\n\nAt Novo Nordisk, I took the much harder path: innovate and disrupt from within. Create small victories and use them to accelerate change.

The marketing material did a poor job of explaining the \"why\" of the product, it was busy and cluttered, and it lacked focus and a core funnel.\n\nI thought I could do better.\n\nIn evenings and weekends, I built an alternative version of the website. Then I reached out to the brand manager - we knew each other a bit from customer service questions. I booked a meeting, made my pitch, and showed her what I'd made and why.\n\nShe could see I'd thought about it deeply. Her response was simply: \"Well, let's try it out then.\"\n\nSales went up. Next week I was in the web design team. Six months later, I was leading it.\n\nLearning: I really appreciate the break she gave me. Looking back, I can see it was a risk on her part - the website had a million visitors a month. But she backed a bet on someone who'd shown initiative and done the work upfront.

      "content": "At Novo Nordisk (2022-2024), when developing health software, every release needs to undergo extensive review by medical, legal and regulatory experts (MLR). The process was designed for simple marketing materials like patient pamphlets, not sophisticated software - but it hadn't evolved.\n\nIn practice, this meant every screen of an application had to be captured in PDF format and reviewed individually. The result: significant delays (backlogs could mean months before review), huge documentation overhead, and an anti-pattern where you had to fully develop everything before getting formal sign-off. It creates the \"CD-ROM software\" pattern - ship once, never iterate.\n\nAt Wegovycare, I'd partly addressed this by automating documentation and informally reviewing prototypes with the review team. That got us from annual releases to every two months.\n\nBut if you want to win any software race, velocity is key. GenAI presented a new opportunity.\n\nI used an internal LLM sandbox to create a RAG model that captured the various guidelines and regulations. Now we could automatically document and review each submission with a full audit trail - the review team only had to rubber-stamp the release.\n\nI also built a prototype agent that plugged into Figma, so designers could query the guidelines before investing too much effort. This allowed product teams to shift left - they could fail something in design, not at review, reducing unnecessary feedback loops.\n\nThe product teams loved it. It validated the approach and demonstrated what was possible. Organisational priorities later shifted and the project was handed to another team, but the proof of concept showed a clear path to dramatically faster release cycles.\n\nLearning: Sometimes you build the right thing at the wrong time.
