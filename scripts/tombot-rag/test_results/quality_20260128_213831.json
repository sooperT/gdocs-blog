I had to get involved.\n\nAfter completing my degree and a Masters in IT, I got into web design and development. Started at a web hosting company answering phones, but convinced them to let me rebuild their website. That led to leading their web team and pioneering industry-first techniques like AJAX domain search.\n\nI've spent most of my career at the intersection of technology, product, and growth. Worked across hosting companies, startups, and eventually moved into health-tech. The last six years I've been in Denmark - first at LEO Innovation Lab learning how to disrupt from within large organisations, and currently at Novo Nordisk as Associate Director of Product Innovation.\n\nThroughout it's been about finding opportunities to use technology to solve real problems and drive meaningful impact.\n\nWould you like to hear more about my experience at Novo Nordisk or my time at the LEO Innovation Lab, or ask about something else?",

I'm driven by outcomes, yes the big stuff like hitting numbers and improving lives, but it often starts small. A microcopy nudge, a well-timed notification, a product loop that compounds, a well-placed thought at the coffee machine. I look for those small sparks that create outsized change.\n\n**Learning:** I've got 20+ years experience and solid product sense, but I've learnt the hard way it's not my ideas that matter. The real power of product management lies in creating space for learning. Curiosity invites new mental models, fresh viewpoints, unexpected opportunities.\n\n**Fun:** This is foundational. When you work on a compelling challenge with good, smart people you respect and can laugh with, everything flows smoother. Great things can happen.\n\nWould you like to hear more about how I've applied this in practice at my recent roles, or ask about something else?",

I understand funnels, experimentation, and conversion optimisation.\n\n**Strategic Thinking:** I'm a systems thinker who sees connections others miss. I work as a thought partner, challenging assumptions, surfacing blindspots, and shaping decisions.\n\n**Execution:** I'm outcome oriented - I find the right outcome, then make it happen. I'm comfortable swimming in the deep end with new domains and high stakes situations.\n\n**Building Trust:** I build alignment across roles, levels, and silos. People trust me to help them think differently through informal leadership.\n\nI'm also technically grounded, which helps me work effectively with engineering teams and understand what's actually feasible.\n\nWould you like to hear more about how I've applied these strengths in specific roles, or ask about something else?",

It was a frustrating experience with poor conversion rates.\n\nI completely reinvented the process. I built a simple text field that interpreted whatever the user entered and searched all domain endings asynchronously. This was actually the first use of AJAX in our technology stack.\n\nThe impact was immediate - new revenue increased by 20% overnight. The approach I created became the industry standard.
