  *** MAJOR HALLUCINATIONS DETECTED ***

  Query: Tell me about yourself
  Section: META
    FABRICATED: I'm British
    Severity: high
    Why: No mention of British nationality in the source content
    FABRICATED: I've been living in Copenhagen since 2010
    Severity: high
    Why: No mention of Copenhagen or living there since 2010 in the source content
    FABRICATED: I have Danish permanent residency
    Severity: high
    Why: No mention of Danish residency status in the source content
    FABRICATED: I'm married with two kids
    Severity: high
    Why: No mention of marital status or children in the source content

  Query: What's your background?
  Section: META.ARC
    FABRICATED: Now I'm at Novo Nordisk as an Associated Director
    Severity: high
    Why: The source content shows the Novo Nordisk role ended in 2022 (2020-2022 timeframe), but the response presents it as current
    FABRICATED: 20 years of experience
    Severity: low
    Why: The timeline shows career starting around 2001-2003, which would be approximately 20+ years by now, so this is reasonable

  Query: Why are you leaving Novo Nordisk?
  Section: TQ.LEAVING
    FABRICATED: Autumn 2024
    Severity: high
    Why: Source content states the restructuring happened in 'Autumn 2025', but the response incorrectly states 'Autumn 2024'

  Query: Tell me about a time you failed
  Section: TQ.FAILURE
    FABRICATED: At LEO Innovation Lab, we were optimising the onboarding funnel and hypothesised that increasing notification opt-ins would increase activation
    Severity: high
    Why: The source content only mentions 'Optimised the wrong part of the funnel' without any specific details about LEO Innovation Lab, onboarding funnels, notification opt-ins, or activation metrics
    FABRICATED: We got clever with a contextually-triggered opt-in at exactly the right moment. The conversion rate was amazing, but activation barely moved
    Severity: high
    Why: These specific implementation details about contextually-triggered opt-ins and activation metrics are completely fabricated and not present in the source content
    FABRICATED: We quickly rolled out a simpler opt-in early in the funnel with much better results
    Severity: high
    Why: This resolution and outcome detail is invented - the source content doesn't mention any follow-up actions or results
    FABRICATED: We had no go-to-market plan and no viable first iteration
    Severity: medium
    Why: While the source mentions the startup never launched due to wanting perfection, these specific reasons (no go-to-market plan, no viable first iteration) are not stated in the source
    FABRICATED: ship in small viable increments to capture value and learn early
    Severity: low
    Why: The source says 'ship in small viable increments' but doesn't mention 'to capture value and learn early' - this is elaboration beyond the source

  Minor issues:

  Query: Tell me about LEO Innovation Lab
  Section: LEO
    Claim: LEO Pharma created to stay ahead of digital disruption in healthcare
    Why: The source only states it was 'established by LEO Pharma' without specifying the motivation about digital disruption
    Claim: We had experts from all sorts of fields - a true melting pot
    Why: This characterization of the team composition is not mentioned in the source content
    Claim: We were too remote from the core business - innovations struggled to find a home back in LEO Pharma. You can't outsource disruption to a separate unit and graft it back on later
    Why: These specific reasons for why the model wasn't sustainable are not provided in the source content, which only states the model 'ultimately wasn't sustainable'
    Claim: it was a formative career moment with accelerated learning that informed my approach at Novo Nordisk
    Why: While the source mentions it was 'a formative career moment - accelerated learning', the specific connection to informing approach at Novo Nordisk is not stated

  Query: What's your AI experience?
  Section: THEME.AI
    Claim: Novo Nordisk
    Why: The source content only mentions 'Novo', not the full company name 'Novo Nordisk'
    Claim: LEO Pharma
    Why: The source content only mentions 'LEO', not the full company name 'LEO Pharma'
