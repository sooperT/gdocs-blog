I focus on driving outcomes, whether that's hitting big numbers, improving lives, or creating change through others. But impact often starts small - a microcopy nudge, a well-timed notification, a product loop that compounds, or even a well-placed thought at the coffee machine. I look forward to finding those sparks.\n\n**Learning** keeps me grounded. I have 20+ years experience and solid product sense, but I've learnt the hard way it's not my ideas that matter most. The real power of product management lies in creating space for learning. Curiosity invites new mental models, fresh viewpoints, and unexpected opportunities.\n\n**Fun** is foundational. When you work on compelling challenges with good, smart people you respect and can laugh with, everything flows smoother. Great things happen.\n\nWould you like to hear more about how I've applied this approach in my recent roles, or ask about something else?",

The thinking was: better we disrupt ourselves than let a competitor do it. They needed different thinking and different ways of working to be truly innovative - staying too close to the mothership would just replicate what already existed.\n\nI worked as a product lead across three different ventures:\n- **TREAT**: I parachuted into their underperforming flagship product, turned it around, then recommended closure\n- **Skincoach**: Built an app for terminally ill cancer patients - some of the most meaningful work I've done\n- **Diagnosis App**: Led an ML and computer vision team\n\nAs product leads, we were essentially mini-CEOs for each venture. I also drove adoption of prototyping and direct user interviews across the organisation, and changed the all-hands format from sharing vanity stats to sharing mistakes.\n\nThe innovation lab was incredibly agile with rapid learning cycles and brilliant peers - it was a formative career moment with accelerated learning. But the model ultimately wasn't sustainable.

This meant they could only search one domain at a time, and they kept hitting domains that were already taken. Frustrating experience with poor conversion rates.\n\nI completely reinvented the process. I created a simple text field that could interpret whatever the user entered and automatically search all domain endings at once, running asynchronously. This was actually the first use of AJAX in our technology stack.\n\nThe results were immediate. New revenue increased by 20% overnight. The approach worked so well that it became the industry standard.
