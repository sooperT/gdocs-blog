  *** MAJOR HALLUCINATIONS DETECTED ***

  Query: Tell me about yourself
  Section: META
    FABRICATED: after my time at Novo Nordisk
    Severity: high
    Why: The source content does not mention Novo Nordisk at all. This appears to be a completely fabricated detail about the person's work history.

  Query: What's your background?
  Section: META.ARC
    FABRICATED: currently at Novo Nordisk as Associate Director of Product Innovation
    Severity: high
    Why: The source content shows Tom's role at Novo Nordisk ended in 2022, and his current status is not specified. The response incorrectly presents this as his current role.

  Query: Why are you leaving Novo Nordisk?
  Section: TQ.LEAVING
    FABRICATED: Autumn 2024
    Severity: high
    Why: Source content states the restructuring happened in 'Autumn 2025', but the response claims it was 'Autumn 2024' - this is a factual error about the timing of events
    FABRICATED: I originally chose health-tech as it was the last industry to be disrupted by digital
    Severity: medium
    Why: This claim about why the person originally chose health-tech is not present in the source content
    FABRICATED: But now AI is changing everything. It's the same energy as the dot-com era - everything is up for grabs again
    Severity: medium
    Why: These specific claims about AI changing everything and comparisons to the dot-com era are not grounded in the source content
    FABRICATED: And I want to be back on that frontier
    Severity: low
    Why: While the source mentions wanting to return to tech-roots, this specific phrasing about being 'back on that frontier' is not in the source content

  Minor issues:

  Query: What's your AI experience?
  Section: THEME.AI
    Claim: Novo Nordisk
    Why: The source content only mentions 'Novo', but the response expands this to 'Novo Nordisk' which is a specific company name not found in the source
    Claim: LEO Pharma
    Why: The source content only mentions 'LEO', but the response expands this to 'LEO Pharma' which is a specific company name not found in the source
