  Query: Tell me about yourself
  Section: META
    FABRICATED: after my time at Novo Nordisk
    Severity: high

  Query: Tell me about a time you failed
  Section: TQ.FAILURE
    FABRICATED: at LEO Pharma
    Severity: high
    Why: The source content mentions optimizing the wrong part of the funnel but does not specify this happened at LEO Pharma. This is a fabricated company attribution.

  Minor issues:

  Query: What's your background?
  Section: META.ARC
    Claim: I'm currently an Associated Director
    Why: The source content shows Tom was promoted to Associated Director at Novo Nordisk during 2020-2022, but that role ended in 2022. The timeline shows 2026 as a separate entry, indicating he's no longer at Novo Nordisk currently.
