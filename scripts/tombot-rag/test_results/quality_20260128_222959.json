Graduated right as the dot.com bubble popped in 2001, so I started with freelance web design and eventually got my foot in the door at a web hosting company.\n\nThat's where I really cut my teeth - started answering phones, won their sales competition, but convinced management to let me rebuild their website. When it drove 1 million visits and boosted sales, I moved into web design and quickly became team lead.\n\nFrom there I progressed through increasingly senior roles in tech companies - Head of New Media, Marketing Director, eventually moving into product management. In 2010 I moved to Denmark and got involved in the startup scene.\n\nThe last decade has been focused on health tech - first at LEO Innovation Lab where I learned how to build products from scratch in a proper innovation environment, then at Novo Nordisk where I'm currently an Associated Director working on digital health products and helping transform how the organisation builds products.\n\nWould you like to hear more about my transition into product management, or my experience in health tech specifically?",

I'm driven by outcomes, whether that's hitting big numbers, improving lives, or creating change through others. But I've learnt it often starts small: a microcopy nudge, a well-timed notification, a product loop that compounds, or even a well-placed thought at the coffee machine. I look forward to finding those sparks.\n\n**Learning** keeps me energised. I have 20+ years of experience and solid product sense, but I've learnt the hard way that it's not *my* ideas that matter. The real power lies in creating space for learning - staying curious about new mental models, fresh viewpoints, and unexpected opportunities.\n\n**Fun** is foundational. When I work on compelling challenges with good, smart people I respect and can laugh with, everything flows smoother. That's when great things happen.\n\nWould you like to know more about how I apply this in practice, or ask about something else?",

I understand funnels, experimentation, and conversion at a deep level.\n\n**Problem-First Discovery:** I excel at exploring new domains without a playbook. I start with the problem, not the solution, and create value where others see uncertainty.\n\n**Systems Thinking:** I see connections that others miss. This helps me identify root causes and design solutions that work across the whole system, not just individual parts.\n\n**Building Trust:** I build alignment across different roles, levels, and silos. People trust me to challenge assumptions, surface blindspots, and be a strategic thought partner.\n\nI'm also technically grounded, which means I can have credible conversations with engineering teams and understand implementation constraints.\n\nWould you like to hear more about how I've applied these strengths in specific situations, or ask about something else?",

I saw a major problem with how domain search worked across the industry.\n\nThe standard process was terrible for users: you had to enter a domain name in a text field, pick the ending from a dropdown menu (.com, .net, etc.), then hit search. You could only search one domain at a time, and people kept hitting domains that were already taken. It was frustrating and killed conversions.\n\nThe technical reason it worked this way was that we had to make separate API calls to each domain registry. But I realised we could do better.\n\nI completely reinvented the process. I built a simple text field that would interpret whatever the user typed and automatically search all domain endings at once using asynchronous calls. This was actually the first time we used AJAX in our technology stack.\n\nThe results were immediate: new revenue increased by 20% overnight. The approach worked so well it became the industry standard. If you search for a domain anywhere today, this is exactly how it works.\n\nWould you like to hear more about how I approach product innovation, or ask about something else?",
