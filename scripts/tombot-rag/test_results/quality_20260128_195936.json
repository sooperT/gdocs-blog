I'm driven by outcomes and the big stuff - hitting numbers, improving lives, driving impact through others. But it often starts in the small things. Small sparks that create outsized change: a microcopy nudge, a well-timed notification, a product loop that compounds, a well placed thought-bomb at the coffee machine, an unspoken truth spoken in a user test. I look forward to finding sparks.\n\n**Learning:** I have 20+ years experience and solid product sense, but I've learnt the hard way it's not *my* ideas that matter. The real power of product management lies in creating space for learning. Curiosity invites new mental models, fresh viewpoints, unexpected opportunities, and the complexity of life. I look forward to learning something new.\n\n**Fun:** This is foundational. When you work on a compelling challenge with good, smart people that you respect and can laugh with, everything flows smoother.

I also changed our all-hands format from sharing vanity stats to sharing mistakes.\n\nThe innovation lab was incredibly agile with rapid learning cycles and brilliant peers. But the model ultimately wasn't sustainable. We were too remote from the core business - innovations struggled to find a home back in LEO Pharma.

We could only check one domain at a time because each ending required a separate API call to different registries.\n\nThe experience was frustrating. People kept running into domains that were already taken, and conversion rates suffered.\n\nI completely reinvented the process. I created a simple text field that could interpret whatever users typed and automatically search all domain endings at once using asynchronous calls. This was actually the first time we used AJAX in our technology stack.\n\nThe results were immediate - new revenue jumped 20% overnight. The approach worked so well it became the industry standard.
