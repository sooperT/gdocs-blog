    "response": "I started with computers in the late 80s when my dad spent a month's salary on our first home computer. I was typing out BASIC from magazines, dealing with syntax errors - it stayed at hobby level for a while.\n\nIn the late 90s, I was studying biology at university when the Internet happened. The dot.com boom was incredible - suddenly kids in bedrooms and garages were reshaping entire industries. I had to get involved, so I started learning web design and coding alongside my degree.\n\nI graduated in 2001 just as the bubble popped. No jobs anywhere, so I did freelance web design and co-founded a mobile ticketing startup that never launched - good idea, just too early.\n\nEventually got my foot in the door answering phones at a web hosting company in 2003. I was good at sales but wanted to do web work. In my spare time I built an alternative website for them, convinced a manager to try it, and when it got 1 million visits and boosted sales, I moved into their web design team.\n\nFrom there I progressed quickly - leading teams, becoming Head of New Media, then switching to other companies across hosting, SaaS startups, and eventually health tech. I moved to Denmark in 2010, learnt Danish, and spent time in the startup scene before joining LEO Innovation Lab and then Novo Nordisk, where I am now.\n\nWould you like to hear more about any particular period, or ask about something else?",

It's the big stuff like hitting numbers and improving lives, but it often starts small. A microcopy nudge, a well-timed notification, a product loop that compounds, a well-placed thought at the coffee machine. I look forward to finding those sparks that create outsized change.\n\n**Learning:** I have 20+ years experience and solid product sense, but I've learnt the hard way it's not my ideas that matter. The real power of product management lies in creating space for learning. Curiosity invites new mental models, fresh viewpoints, unexpected opportunities. I look forward to learning something new.\n\n**Fun:** This is foundational. When you work on a compelling challenge with good, smart people that you respect and can laugh with, everything flows smoother. Great things can happen.\n\nWould you like to hear more about how I've applied this in practice at Novo Nordisk or ask about something else?",

I'm comfortable jumping into new domains with high stakes - what I call being a \"deep-end swimmer.\" I see connections others miss, which helps me surface blindspots and challenge assumptions effectively.\n\n**Leadership & Influence:** I build alignment across different roles, levels, and organisational silos. I work as a strategic thought partner, helping people think differently without formal authority. I'm technically fluent, which keeps me grounded in reality.\n\n**Discovery:** I excel at problem-first exploration and creating value where there's no existing playbook.

Frustrating experience, poor conversion.\n\nI reinvented the process with a simple text field that interpreted whatever the user entered and searched all endings asynchronously. It was the first use of AJAX in our stack.\n\nNew revenue increased by 20% overnight.
