        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>Hi, I'm Tom. I build products and think about systems.</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>

        <p>I work in product management, focusing on the intersection of technology, user experience, and business strategy. I'm particularly interested in systems thinking and how small changes can create large-scale effects.</p>

        <h2>This Site</h2>

        <p>This blog is my space for writing about product, technology, systems thinking, and life. The design is inspired by 1980s teletext and CRT monitors - a nostalgic aesthetic that represents modern thinking with an old soul.</p>

        <p>The site is built with a custom publishing system that converts Google Docs to HTML, allowing me to write in a familiar environment while maintaining full control over the presentation.</p>

        <h2>Get in Touch</h2>

        <p>You can find me on various platforms or reach out via email.</p>

        <p><em>This page will be populated with actual content from a Google Doc in the final implementation.</em></p>
